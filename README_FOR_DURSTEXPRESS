# Setup
1. Follow normal setup from README.md
2. Run `bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate` inside app container
3. Go to http://localhost:8000/drink/index

# Notes
* The clone URL in your readme seems incorrect. I cloned this repository instead.
* I'm assuming I should create my own storage so I chose MySQL.
* I injected the entity manager and the repository to simplify future testing.
* There's a lot of logic in the controller which is fine for the current use case. In bigger applications I would split this up into different classes and keep the controllers small.
* I recently did code challenges for other companies which included building a REST API and automated testing. If you're interested in any of these, let me know.

# Todo
* MySQL credentials could be taken from environment variables
* Tests
* Error handling
* Styling
* Flash messages
* Confirmation before deletion
* Back/cancel buttons

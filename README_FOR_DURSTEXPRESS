# Setup
1. Follow normal setup from README.md
2. Run `bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate` inside app container
3. Go to http://localhost:8000/drink/index

# Notes
* The clone URL in your readme seems incorrect. I cloned this repository instead.
* I'm assuming I should create my own storage so I chose MySQL.

# Todo
* MySQL credentials could be taken from environment variables
* Everything should be tested. I'm happy to send over other code challenges which include automated tests.
* Error handling
* Styling
